```
Usage: py DiceRoller.py [#dice] [d/w] [dice size] [s]

Allowed arguments are: [n]dx, where x is the type n is the amount of dice to roll. n can be omitted and defaults to 1.
If '7' or 'd7' is used, the system will subsitute The Seven RPG system dicerolls instead of regular dice.
You can also use 'w' instead of 'd' between the two numbers to switch to Storyteller Dice (number of d10 against Target Number)
You can add 's' as another argument after the first one to see the intermediate rolls and not just the total.
